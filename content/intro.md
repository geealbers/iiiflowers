To better see where IIIF is being employed by Quire versus where the static JPG is being used, IIIF image tiles are in color, the static JPG source images are in black and white.

Using a IIIF image in the **q-figure** shortcode:

{{< q-figure id="irises" >}}

Using IIIF images in the **q-figure-group** shortcode:

{{< q-figure-group grid="2" id="vase-of-flowers, flowers, flowers-and-beetles, still-life" >}}

Using IIIF image from an **external info.json** file and internal static fallback JPG:

{{< q-figure id="iris-sibirica" >}}
