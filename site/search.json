Should we have these set up but empty in the default starter? And/or could we possibly eliminate the images directory and just have users put images for processing directly in iiif?\n  For workflow (ours internally and users) would best practice be to add the high-res image, process it, and then remove it from the project? So, not to commit to a GitHub repository? And process related, I’m going to need to test moving the processed image tiles into a figures sub-module that we can keep private, in the case of third-party licensed images. And I’m a little concerned about overall repository file sizes. The compressed site directory for this sample project with five IIIIF image tile sets is 270MB, versus 35MB without the IIIF tiles.\n  When running quire imageslice, the command line prints ℹ Finding images to process... and then can go quiet for a very long time. It took me about 20 minutes to slice a 130MB file for Irises. Let’s consider adding to this output so users don’t feel it’s hung up. Maybe something like ℹ Processing images, this may take a while depending on the image file sizes ...\n  The command also checks to make sure the images are of a proceessable file format type and outputs a message if not. This is useful in normal circumstances, like if a user tries to process a TIF, but it‘s also messaging about files that most users can’t see, like: ✖ Cannot slice file .DS_Store. File type must be: .jp2, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg.. Can we think about how to handle this differently?\n  Should we consider changing the command to quire iiif?\n  The catalogue entry viewer won't display IIIF images unless there's another non-IIIF image included in the carousel. DEV-7105\n  (As an aside, let’s look at turning off mouseover/touch zoom behavior in the catalogue entry viewer. It’s problematic for users when I think the +/- controls suffice.)\n  In themes/default/source/js/deepzoom.js the max zoom level (lines 68 and 83) is set at 4 which was really limiting. I changed it to 10 as a test and I could zoom fully in on all the images, but actually too far in. See the Irises catalouge entry as a good example. Is the imageslice command slicing to a consistent number of levels? Or is it based on the size of the image being sliced? Can we somehow read how many layers are available and set the zoom level to that? And whatever the solution, how will it work with IIIF images being called from external pre-existing sources?\n  In the figure shortcodes, IIIF is not being delployed at all. The figure modal zoom containters are only displaying the static src JPGs defined for each image in figures.yml.\n  And what about those static JPGs? Should Quire users continue including them to use for things like the contents image grids, and the PDF and e-book outputs? Or, is it possible to employ IIIF for these things too?\n  ","id":0,"length":522,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"To better see where IIIF is being employed by Quire versus where the static JPG is being used, IIIF image tiles are in color, the static JPG source images are in black and white.\nUsing a IIIF image in the q-figure shortcode:\n Irises, Vincent van Gogh, 1889.

There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he began Irises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints.\nThere are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to the Salon des Indépendants in September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition: \u0026ldquo;[It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life.\u0026rdquo;\nEach one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote: \u0026ldquo;How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers!\u0026rdquo;\n","id":3,"length":183,"title":"1.

Arranged in a terracotta vase displaying an antique relief, Jan van Huysum included flowers from all seasons of the year\u0026ndash;roses, anemones, hyacinths, tulips, and more\u0026ndash;and painted them directly from life. The flowers\u0026rsquo; nearly overripe quality attests both to nature's bounty and its transience. The bouquet is ordered in a loose pyramidal shape, with flowers and greenery almost bursting to be free of the vase. Butterflies and other insects fly or crawl amongst the arrangement, and drops of water are visible on leafs and shiny petals.\nVan Huysum painstakingly applied layer upon layer of thin oil glazes to capture the brilliant colors and delicate textures of the blossoms. Because each flower could only be painted while in season, it sometimes took the artist several years to complete a single painting.\n","id":4,"length":145,"title":"2.

[Flowers]","type":"","url":""},{"content":"In the late 1400s, northern European artists began to study and draw plants and animals with a greater interest in accuracy. Although showing the uniqueness of each of these specimens was undoubtedly important to Hans Hoffmann, he equally tried to portray the individual beauty of each flower and insect. He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect.\nHoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s. Scholars consider this one of the first examples of still life painting.\n","id":6,"length":168,"title":"4.
