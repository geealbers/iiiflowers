## Quire Default Starter

The default starter contains demo content used as placeholder when starting a new Quire project. It is included by default when starting a new Quire project with the `quire new` command. 

The default starter is paired with the [default theme](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/themes/default), designed to showcase and make use of Quire’s core features out of the box.
